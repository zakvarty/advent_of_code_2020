## Day 1 - Adding to :two: :zero: :two: :zero: : 

_Task 1_: Find the product of the two numbers in input.txt that sum to 2020 :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_: Find the product of the three numbers in input.txt that sum to 2020 :heavy_check_mark: 


## Day 2 - Password checking :lock: :

_Task 1_:  Number of valid passwords, count of given letter is in the given range :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  Number of valid passwords, given letter occurs exactly once at given locations (passwords are 1-indexed) :heavy_check_mark: 


## Day 3 - Toboggan Trajectory :skier: :
The input file is a discrete-time ski slope where "." is snow and ""#" is a tree. You start at line 1 and character 1 and get to pick your gradient.  

_Task 1_:  You choose to move right 3 characters and down 1 line at each time step. How many trees would you hit on your way down the mountain? :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  What is the product of the number of trees you would hit taking using each of the following gradients? :heavy_check_mark: 
	
	- Right 1, down 1.
	- Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
	- Right 5, down 1.
	- Right 7, down 1.
	- Right 1, down 2.


## Day 4 - Passport Processing :passport_control: :

_Task 1_:  Count the number of documents that have fields for all the required information  :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  Count the number of documents that have fields for all the required information and this information is given in the correct format :heavy_check_mark: 


## Day 5 - Binary Boarding :seat: :

_Task 1_:  Convert binary seat allocations to seat IDs. What is the highest seat ID?  :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  Some seats are missing at the front and back of this plane, but all existing seats are taken. What is your seat ID?  :heavy_check_mark: 


##  Day 6 - Custom Customs :customs: :

_Task 1_:  For each group of strings (blank lines separate groups) find the number of unique letters within that group. What is the sum over all groups?  :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  For each group of strings (blank lines separate groups) find the number of letters within all strings of that group. What is the sum over all groups?  :heavy_check_mark: 


##  Day 7 - Handy Haversacks :school_satchel: :
__Key words:__ recursion, regex.

_Task 1_: How many bagscontain at least one "shiny gold" bag?  :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  How many bags are nested in a "shiny gold" bag?  :heavy_check_mark: 


##  Day 8 - Handheld Halting :stop_sign: :
__Key words:__ looping, str_replace()

_Task 1_: What is the value of the accumulator just before the infinite loop begins?  :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  Change one "jmp" to "nop" (or the other way around) so that the end of file is reached.  What is the final accumulator value?  :heavy_check_mark: 

##  Day 9 - Encoding Error :left_luggage: :
__Key words:__ 

_Task 1_: A number is valid if if can be expressed as the sum of two of the previous ```preamble_length``` numbers. Find the value of the first number that is not valid. :heavy_check_mark:

_Task 2_:  Find the contiguous subset of the numbers that sum to the previous answer. What is the sum of the largest and smallest numbers in this set?:heavy_check_mark: 

##  Day 10 - Adaptor Array :electric_plug: :
__Key words:__ Combinatorics, suppressing scientific notation

_Task 1_: Using all adaptors, find the number of 1 and 3 jolt differences. What is their product? :heavy_check_mark:

_Task 2_:  Find the number of valid adaptor combinations. (Gah.) :heavy_check_mark:


##  Day 11 - Seating System :chair: :
__Key words:__ Image smoothing, queen-neighbours

_Task 1_: Update seat occupancy based on number of occupied neighbours and the given rules. When this converges, how many occupied seats are there? :heavy_check_mark:

_Task 2_:  The decison rules have changed. They are now based on the queen-neighbour count and maximum of  5 neighbours. How many occupied seats at convergence now? :heavy_check_mark: (look at smarter solutions)

Coding challenges for [advent of code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

## Day 1 - Adding to :two: :zero: :two: :zero: : 

_Task 1_: Find the product of the two numbers in input.txt that sum to 2020 :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_: Find the product of the three numbers in input.txt that sum to 2020 :heavy_check_mark: 


## Day 2 - Password checking :lock: :

_Task 1_:  Number of valid passwords, count of given letter is in the given range :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  Number of valid passwords, given letter occurs exactly once at given locations (passwords are 1-indexed) :heavy_check_mark: 


## Day 3 - Toboggan Trajectory :skier: :
The input file is a discrete-time ski slope where "." is snow and ""#" is a tree. You start at line 1 and character 1 and get to pick your gradient.  

_Task 1_:  You choose to move right 3 characters and down 1 line at each time step. How many trees would you hit on your way down the mountain? :heavy_check_mark: 

_Task 2_:  What is the product of the number of trees you would hit taking using each of the following gradients? :heavy_check_mark: 
	
	- Right 1, down 1.
	- Right 3, down 1. (This is the slope you already checked.)
	- Right 5, down 1.
	- Right 7, down 1.
	- Right 1, down 2.
